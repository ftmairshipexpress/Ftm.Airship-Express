/**
 * PerDev account-level audit attribution.
 *
 * Persists WHO PERFORMED an action (the authenticated account) separately from
 * the business-table employee identity, using the existing live table
 * `hr3_audit_events`. No schema change, no RPC, no transaction wrapper.
 *
 * Dimension mapping:
 *
 *   WHO PERFORMED THE ACTION?   → actor_type + actor_id (hr_admin.id)
 *   WHICH EMPLOYEE IS LINKED?   → employeeUuid / employeeIdNumber (context only)
 *   WHO IS THE BUSINESS SUBJECT? → entity_type + entity_id (the record)
 *
 * `actor_id` is ALWAYS the authenticated account id (`hr_admin.id`), never the
 * linked employee UUID. The business record keeps its existing employee FK
 * (`goals.assigned_by`, `feedback.given_by` → `hr1_employees.id`).
 *
 * REASON / ACTION CONVENTION
 * --------------------------
 * Verified live: `hr3_audit_events` has a NOT NULL `action` column with NO
 * default (the operation is carried in the stable `<entity>.<verb>` format),
 * and a `reason` column the same shape. Both are written with the SAME
 * canonical string so the operation is consistently readable either way:
 *
 *   goal.created           goal was created
 *   goal.updated           goal fields/status were updated by HR admin
 *   goal.progress_updated  employee recorded progress
 *   goal.submitted         employee submitted for completion
 *   goal.completed         HR admin moved pending_completion → completed
 *   goal.proposal_created  employee created a goal proposal (draft)
 *   goal.proposal_updated  employee edited their draft/returned proposal
 *   goal.proposal_submitted employee submitted a proposal for manager review
 *   goal.proposal_approved reviewer approved a proposal (weight assigned)
 *   goal.proposal_returned reviewer returned a proposal for revision
 *   goal.proposal_rejected reviewer rejected a proposal (terminal)
 *   checkin.created        check-in was created
 *   checkin.message_posted a conversation message/reply was posted to a check-in
 *   checkin.acknowledged   the subject employee acknowledged a check-in
 *   appraisal.created      appraisal record was created (state: draft)
 *   appraisal.self_assessment_submitted   employee moved draft → self_assessment
 *   appraisal.manager_assessment_submitted reviewer moved self_assessment → manager_assessment
 *   appraisal.finalized    reviewer moved manager_assessment → finalized
 *   appraisal.acknowledged employee moved finalized → acknowledged
 *   cycle.created          performance cycle created (state: draft)
 *   cycle.opened           draft cycle opened (status → open)
 *   cycle.stage_advanced   cycle advanced exactly one stage
 *   cycle.closed           cycle closed (finalization → closed)
 *   competency.created     competency library entry created
 *   competency.updated     competency library fields edited
 *   position_competency.created    competency assigned required to a position
 *   position_competency.updated    required level of a position requirement changed
 *   employee_competency.assessed   employee competency assessment recorded
 *   course.created         training course created
 *   course.updated         training course fields edited
 *   course_enrollment.created     employee enrolled in a course
 *   course_enrollment.updated     course enrollment progress/status/completion changed
 *   training_session.created      training session created
 *   training_session.updated      training session fields edited
 *   training_enrollment.created   employee enrolled in a training session
 *   training_enrollment.updated   session approval/attendance updated
 *   training_evaluation.created   employee submitted a session evaluation
 *   certification.created         certification issued to an employee
 *   critical_position.created     critical position added to succession plan
 *   critical_position.updated     critical position risk/reason edited
 *   critical_position.deleted     critical position removed from succession plan
 *   succession_candidate.added    employee marked as successor to a position
 *   succession_candidate.updated  candidate readiness/ratings/notes edited
 *   succession_candidate.removed  candidate removed from a critical position
 *   recognition.created           employee recognition posted
 *   badge.created                 badge library entry created
 *   badge.updated                 badge library fields edited
 *   badge.deleted                 badge library entry removed (only when unused)
  *   points.awarded                employee point balance set or adjusted
  *   redemption.created            reward redemption requested
  *   redemption.updated            redemption status/description changed
  *   feedback.requested            employee requested feedback from a peer/manager
  *   feedback.responded            recipient fulfilled a feedback request
  *   feedback.declined             recipient declined a feedback request
 *   development_plan_item.created development plan item added to an appraisal
 *   development_plan_item.updated development plan item fields edited
 *   development_plan_item.deleted development plan item removed
 *   development_plan_item.follow_through employee advanced a finalized
 *     development action one forward step (not_started → in_progress →
 *     completed); content (action/target/owner/appraisal) never changes
  *
 * Recognition is create-only (historical record; schema has no updated_at or
 * status columns), so no recognition.update/approve/reject events exist. Badge
 * assignment happens by attaching `badge_id` to a recognition (no separate
 * assignment table), so no badge.assign event exists. Points are not linked to
 * recognitions/redemptions by any trigger, so only the explicit set/adjust
 * balance mutation is recorded.
 *
 * Also recorded on the existing `action` column (required by the live schema)
 * with the identical value.
 *
 * ENTITY TYPE CONVENTION
 * ----------------------
 *   goal      → `hr3_performance_goals` row (entity_id = goal.id)
 *   check_in  → `hr3_performance_feedback` row with feedback_type='check_in'
 *               (entity_id = feedback.id)
 *   appraisal → `hr3_performance_appraisals` row (entity_id = appraisal.id)
 *   performance_cycle → `hr3_performance_cycles` row (entity_id = cycle.id)
 *   competency → `hr3_competencies` row (entity_id = competency.id)
 *   position_competency → `hr3_position_competency_requirements` row
 *               (entity_id = the position↔competency assignment row id)
 *   employee_competency → `hr3_employee_competency_scores` row
 *               (entity_id = the assessment row id)
 *   critical_position → `hr3_critical_positions` row
 *               (entity_id = the critical position row id)
 *   succession_candidate → `hr3_succession_candidates` row
 *               (entity_id = the candidate row id)
 *   recognition → `hr3_recognitions` row (entity_id = the recognition id)
 *   badge → `hr3_badges` row (entity_id = the badge id)
 *   employee_points → `hr3_employee_points` row
 *               (entity_id = the balance row id)
  *   reward_redemption → `hr3_reward_redemptions` row
  *               (entity_id = the redemption id)
  *   feedback_request → `hr3_performance_feedback_requests` row
  *               (entity_id = the request id). `old_data`/`new_data` carry
  *               ids, status, and timestamps ONLY — never `request_message`
  *               or `response_message` content.
 *
 * ATOMICITY LIMITATION
 * --------------------
 * The business mutation and the audit insert are two separate PostgREST calls
 * with no shared transaction (the PerDev layer has no RPC/transaction
 * abstraction). This helper therefore cannot make them atomic. Callers MUST run
 * the business mutation first and, if this helper returns a failure response,
 * surface it instead of reporting success — the write has happened but its
 * required attribution is unverified. See each domain caller.
