/**
 * Appraisal / Evaluation domain (foundation + scoring).
 *
 * A PerDev appraisal is a FORMAL, staged evaluation — deliberately distinct
 * from Check-ins, which are ongoing informal feedback. It reuses the existing
 * live table `hr3_performance_appraisals`.
 *
 * WORKFLOW (state-controlled via the existing `status` column):
 *
 *   draft ──► self_assessment ──► manager_assessment ──► acknowledged ──► finalized
 *
 * New appraisals are created as `draft`; the HR reviewer releases them with
 * start-self-assessment. The employee acknowledges the submitted manager
 * assessment BEFORE HR finalization; `finalized` is the terminal immutable
 * state. An explicit HR override may finalize a submitted-but-unacknowledged
 * manager assessment with a recorded reason (no separate status).
 *
 * The live `status` column is an unconstrained varchar (verified live: default
 * 'draft'; an inherited legacy row stores 'reviewed'). The status values above
 * are a server-defined vocabulary, and every transition is enforced by the
 * server with a guarded update (`.eq("status", expectedFrom)`) so the client
 * can never skip stages, move backwards, reopen finalized/acknowledged records,
 * or inject an arbitrary status.
 *
 * LEGACY / UNKNOWN STATUSES
 *   Records whose `status` is not in the vocabulary (e.g. the inherited row
 *   with status 'reviewed') are readable but have NO allowed transitions: they
 *   cannot be modified through this foundation.
 *
 * SCORING (approved rules, computed ONCE during finalization)
 *   - Final Score = (Goal Score × 0.60) + (Competency Score × 0.40).
 *   - Goal Score = Σ(goal rating × goal weight), weights must total 100%.
 *   - Competency Score = average of the applicable appraisal competency
 *     ratings (equal weights).
 *   - Final Performance Rating = the single approved band resolved from the
 *     unrounded final score; persisted as the band rank (1..5) in
 *     `performance_rating`. `letter_grade` is NEVER populated.
 *   - Scoring inputs (goal + competency ratings) are required at finalization,
 *     stored in the appointment result tables, and are NOT recomputed on later
 *     reads of an already-finalized record.
 *   - `self_rating` never contributes mathematically to any score.
 *
 * IDENTITY MODEL (as the live schema provides):
 *
 *   employee_id           subject employee (hr1_employees.id)
 *   reviewer_id           reviewer's linked employee identity
 *   reviewer_hr_admin_id  reviewer HR account (hr_admin.id)
 *
 * `reviewer_id` alone never identifies the actual account; the account is
 * `reviewer_hr_admin_id`, resolved through the shared actor chain. Protected
 * operations derive every identity server-side from the authenticated session;
 * the client can never set `reviewer_id`, `reviewer_hr_admin_id`, `status`,
 * or the actor.
 *
 * MANAGER AUTHORIZATION SEAM
 *   Manager Assessment is authorized by the EXACT evaluator relationship
 *   recorded on the appraisal: `evaluator_id === authenticated employeeUuid`.
 *   If that relationship does not match, it is a 403. The HR Admin process
 *   administrator cannot submit the manager assessment. Only the assigned
 *   evaluator/manager can.
 *
 *   Finalization is authorized by the HR Admin reviewer relationship:
 *   `reviewer_hr_admin_id === authenticated hrAdminId` AND
 *   `reviewer_id === authenticated employeeUuid`. The Manager cannot finalize.
 *
 * SELF-ASSESSMENT FIELDS USED
 *   `strengths`, `improvements` (narrative, server DOMAIN length-capped). The
 *   `comments` field is reserved for the reviewer's evaluation narrative.
