/**
 * PerDev-owned appraisal analytics provider for downstream HR Analytics
 * (Phase 6 Part 3). APPRAISAL AGGREGATES ONLY.
 *
 * OWNERSHIP: PerDev owns the performance result. This module aggregates
 * ONLY persisted finalized appraisal facts sourced from PerDev-owned
 * appraisal and cycle data. It creates no tables, snapshots, or sync jobs,
 * performs no writes of any kind, and modifies no external-module behavior.
 *
 * AUTHORITY RULE: only finalized appraisals contribute, witnessed by
 * `finalized_at` (set exactly once at finalization, never cleared).
 * Acknowledged-but-unfinalized records are still in flight and are skipped
 * without counting as invalid; legacy acknowledged records carry
 * `finalized_at` and remain included. Pre-finalization rows are excluded
 * server-side. No synthetic fallback is ever constructed — goal averages,
 * competency averages, partial ratings, and other substitutes are not
 * authoritative and are not computed here. Persisted final_score is read,
 * never recalculated (60% Goals + 40% Competencies stays in scoring.ts).
 *
 * COUNT SEMANTICS: every metric counts eligible APPRAISAL RECORDS, never
 * employees. Multiple finalized appraisals for one employee/cycle are
 * preserved (no dedup): each is one observation in counts, average, and
 * distribution. No completion rate is produced (no authoritative
 * denominator exists) and no ranking is produced.
 *
 * VALIDITY SPLIT: status/lifecycle counts include every eligible record;
 * score/rating metrics include only rows with a valid value for that
 * field. invalidResultCount increments ONCE per eligible appraisal when
 * either required result field is invalid (never double-counted).
 *
 * AUTHORIZATION: restricted to the existing PerDev HR-admin scope
 * (strongest existing server authorization; no new roles, accounts, or
 * secrets are invented). CROSS-MODULE LIMITATION: an external analytics
 * consumer therefore needs a PerDev HR-admin session today. A narrower
 * downstream read permission is a future design dependency and must remain
 * narrower than PerDev admin.
