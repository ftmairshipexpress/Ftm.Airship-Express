/**
 * My Development — employee self-scope read-only aggregation service.
 *
 * Server-authoritative "own data only" composition for the future Employee
 * My Development experience. The function accepts NO employee identity: the
 * subject is always derived from the authenticated actor, so IDOR is
 * impossible by construction (there is no identifier to tamper with).
 *
 * Scope policy (mirrors every existing dual-mode loader):
 * - Employee / Manager: the actor's OWN hr1 employee UUID. Managers receive
 *   their own development data only — never direct-report or team data.
 * - PerDev HR Admin: own linked-employee profile only (loaders are called
 *   with an explicit own-employee filter so their org-wide branch can never
 *   engage); denied when no linked employee identity exists. This endpoint
 *   is not a replacement for the HR Development Profile.
 * - Non-PerDev HR admin: denied (403), matching all existing PerDev policy.
 * - Unauthenticated: the actor resolver's own 401/403 passes through.
 *
 * Included sources (all read-only; zero writes, zero audit rows):
 * - Development Actions: own `hr3_performance_development_plan_items` rows
 *   reached per-appraisal through the scoped `listDevPlanItems` (which
 *   re-authorizes each appraisal), restricted to finalized appraisals
 *   (`finalized_at` set) so in-flight appraisal work never leaks into
 *   history.
 * - Competencies: own profile via `listEmployeeCompetencies` (gap/required
 *   levels as computed by the existing model; nothing invented).
 * - Learning: own enrollments via the dual-mode L&D loaders (self-scope
 *   forced server-side) plus catalog reads for display labels.
 * - Certifications: own rows via `listCertifications`.
 *
 * Never included: succession/Candidates, other employees, HR account
 * attribution, approver identities, assessor identities.
