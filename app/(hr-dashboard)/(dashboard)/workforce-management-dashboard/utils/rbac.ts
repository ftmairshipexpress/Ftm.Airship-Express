/**
 * Role-Based Access Control helpers.
 *
 * These are used both client-side (to conditionally render actions) and
 * server-side (to authorize API routes). RLS in Postgres is the ultimate
 * enforcement layer — these helpers are the application-level gate.
 *
 * The roster stores each employee's real position as their `role`. The app-level
 * HR Admin / Operations Manager / Fleet Driver roles are kept for the demo
 * identity and as fallbacks; the real positions map onto them like so:
 *   - HR Admin power:   HR Admin, HR Generalist, HR Officer
 *   - Manager power:    Operations Manager, Office-in-Charge
 *   - Driver view:      all rider/driver positions + Fleet Driver
